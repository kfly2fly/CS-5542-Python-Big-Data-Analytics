# Python and Deep Learning

This repo is a place where source code and documentation can be added for CS-5542 Big Data Analytics. 



Every week we would have In Class Programming (ICP) assignments where we would apply things we have learned in class. This repo contains these ICP assignments.


Description of this course:
Big Data analytics focus on analyzing large amounts of data to find useful information and to  make  use  of  the  information  for  better  business  decisions.  This  course  introduces students to the practice and potential of big data analytics and applications. In this course, students  will  have  hand-on  experience  with  Big  Data  Analytics  technologies  (Apache Spark, TensorFlow) and tools (Intellij, Pycharm, Maven/SBT, MongoDB) for the analysis of big data sets with mobile/Web apps (Visual Question answering, Image Classification). Students  will  learn  how  to  develop  highly  interactive  and  real-time  applications  for intelligent robots.
